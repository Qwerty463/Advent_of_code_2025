The first part of day 1 was pretty simple. i loaded in the individual lines and split them to find if they were going Left or Right. 
If they're going Left we 're going down, so the point at which we change will be 0
If they're going Right, we're going up, so the point at which we change will be 99
Originally, i had 2 while loops to sort this out, which worked fine for the first part; however, it was during the 2nd part that i made the change to use a for loop 
It is more inefficient, and will be noticable for longer combinations, but it works fine and gives the correct answer
for the first part we want to find when it ends on a 0, meaning we can ignore Lock when it is in this section of code:
                    for (int i = 0; i < Integer.parseInt(line); i++) {
                        Lock += (adder);
                        if (Lock < 0 || Lock > 99) {//if it goes right on 0, we cannot
                            Lock += (adder * -100);
                        }
                        if (Lock == 0) {
                            Part2password++;
                        }
                    }
and just look for when it is  0 outside of it

The second part was more difficult, as i was trying to modify my existing while loops to fit into what i needed. this kept causing errors
where if it started on a 0, it would add multiple times, rather than only once. i spent quite a bit of time on this, and decided in the end
to use the less efficient option seen above, after failing for several hours to get it to work how i wanted.
i can think of several better options, but i'm unsure as to how to implement them without breaking the code
